# MakerWheel
MakerWheel is an open source hardware project licensed under the CERN Open Hardware License (Version 1.2).  A copy of the license can be found in this github repository.  The goal of the MakerWheel project is to develop a low cost alternative to traditional linear and rotary motion components.

MakerWheels are 3D printed wheels that integrate with standard threaded rods and screws. The design of the wheel allows it to be used in three primary applications: 1) a roller wheel in a linear slide, 2) a gear in a rack-and-pinion, and 3) a worm gear.  MakerWheels are great for creating low cost prototypes and educational models of motion systems.
